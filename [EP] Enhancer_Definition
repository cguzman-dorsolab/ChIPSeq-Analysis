### It is important to define what exactly an enhancer is before we continue trying to determine whether there KAP1 and 7SK snRNP is truly enriched at enhancers or not.

We know that enhancers typically contain several histone marks and (paused?) Pol II. (Kim, et al. 2015) These include:
1) H3K4me1
2) H3K27Ac
3) Pol II

Our current definition is focusing on:
1) H3K4me1
2) Pol II
3) H3K27Ac
4) Little or no H3K4me3
